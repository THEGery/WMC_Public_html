### About

The website is a demonstration of what I've learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
For that reason the main content of the website is there to show the functionality of the underling code.
It's less about a common topic and more about the code.
The main connection that ties the website together is: HTML, CSS and JavaScript itself.

The content of the website (at this time) is there to support the code and showcase it's funtionality.
